# Functions for processing Tanner crab data from the Tanner crab survey.  
#   There are four areas, all in one input file. 

## load packages -----------
library(tidyverse)
library(weights)
library(broom)

### short term function ----------------
#input is file with last four years of data summarized by pot
# area
# year
