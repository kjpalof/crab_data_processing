# Areas: Tanner crab survey areas - includes Holkham, Thomas, Glacier Bay and Icy Strait
# code to process data from Ocean AK to use in crab CSA models.  
# Prior to 2016 this was done in excel then JMP

#####Load ------------

#####Load Data ---------------------------------------------------
# change input file and input folder for each
dat <- read.csv("./data/TCS/tanner crab survey for CSA_13_18.csv")
# this is input from OceanAK - set up as red crab survey data for CSA
area <- read.csv("./data/TCS/TCSstrata_area.csv")

# brought in all data since 2013 - this was after survey was stratified.  Older data needs to be imported
# from data file and NOT OceanAK since it won't have survey strata designations in OceanAK
# biomass <- read.csv() # need to bring this in for figures later.

head(dat)
glimpse(dat) # confirm that data was read in correctly.

##### Initial review of new data ---------------------------------
# remove pots with Pot condition code that's not "normal" or 1

# before moving forward.

# check pot 15, 2013 Holkham Bay - pull again from OceanAK

# also need to check soak time and to make sure all crab that were measured have a recruit status
#come back later and add a soak time column - tanner soak time should be between 16-20??? double check this
