# K.Palof  ADF&G
# 7-8-19 updated for 2018 fishery
# code here summarizes harvest data for the current year RKC
# this code is set for the 2017 fishery.

# Code added at the end of this file to estimate the harvest rate for 2017 fishery.
#     Need to have the updated 2018 biomass estimates file for this.
# harvest data from fish tickets in OceanAK summarize for use in Southeast RKC CSA's 
# have to modify the output from "detailed fish tickets" need to add "Number of Animals...sum" to this.

# commercial catch
