##Load Packages/functions ---------------------------------

#####Load Data ---------------------------------------------------
# change input file and input folder for each
dat <- read.csv(paste0('./data/redcrab/', survey.location,'/RKC survey CSA_EI_17_18.csv'))
                  # this is input from OceanAK - set up as red crab survey data for CSA

 ## !!!!  this file will be 'EI_perpot_all_16' and just get updated with current years data.

# file for all locations.  Has legal and mature biomass from CSA, harvest

##### Initial review ---------------------------------
# remove pots with Pot condition code that's not "normal" or 1 
levels(dat$Pot.Condition)
dat %>%
  filter(Pot.Condition == "Normal"|Pot.Condition == "Not observed") -> dat1

dat1 %>%

# before moving forward.
dat1 %>% filter(Recruit.Status == "", Number.Of.Specimens >= 1)

# also need to check soak time and to make sure all crab that were measured have a recruit status
# come back later and add a soak time column - RKC soak time should be between 18-24??? double check this

##### By Pot ----------------------------------------------------
#Now summarize by pot - remember to keep areas seperate.
#Need Number of Specimens by recruit class
dat1 %>%
  group_by(Year, Location, Trip.No, Pot.No, Density.Strata.Code, Recruit.Status) %>%

head(dat3)# check to make sure things worked.

# Join area input file with dat3 - which is the data summarized by pot.  Each sampling area has it's own area file or area per
#     strata.  This is used to calculating the weighting for weighted CPUE.
dat3 %>%

#Calculates the number of pots per strata.

# need to combine data sets to accomplish this.
